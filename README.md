# 90 Days to Rebuild: From Laid Off to a Scarce AI Backend Engineer

**Day 0 — December 26, 2025 (the day after Christmas)**

This repository starts **after Christmas 2025**.  
No holidays. No excuses. No private drafts.

This is public by design.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Land a backend / AI backend offer **by the end of March 2026**
- Stay on track with the **H-1B** employment path
- Rebuild myself into a **scarce, production-ready AI backend engineer**

---

## 🔥 Why This Repo Exists

This repository is my **accountability arena**.

By making everything public, I remove the option to disappear, procrastinate, or pretend progress is happening.

**Every day, something ships.**  
Code, documentation, experiments, benchmarks, or written learnings.

No zero days.

---

## 🧠 What I Am Building

I am using **AI + Oracle Database 23ai** to push enterprise backend engineering further.

This is not about demos that look good on Twitter.  
This is about **real systems**:

- Backend services that talk to real databases
- Data modeling and performance tradeoffs
- AI features that actually belong in backend systems
- Design decisions explained clearly enough for interviews

The goal is to turn:
> “backend + database + AI”  
into a **repeatable, interview-proven engineering skillset**.

---

## 📦 Daily Deliverables

Each day may include one or more of the following:

- Production-style backend code
- Database schemas, tuning, or benchmarks
- AI integrations (RAG, embeddings, agents — only when justified)
- Blog-style technical write-ups
- Short videos or demos
- Postmortems and lessons learned

**Rule:**  
If a day exists, it has a commit.

## 🗺️ High-Level Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Days 0–7)
- Environment setup (Oracle 23ai, backend framework, tooling)
- Minimal backend + database integration
- First end-to-end working service
- Clear documentation from Day 0

### Phase 2 — Real Projects (Days 8–45)
- 2–3 portfolio-grade backend systems
- Database-heavy use cases
- Performance, scalability, and tradeoff analysis
- AI features added only where they make architectural sense

### Phase 3 — Interview & Offer Sprint (Days 46–90)
- System design and database deep dives
- Project refinement for interviews
- Resume and GitHub optimization
- Mock interviews and targeted applications

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Evolving)

- **Database:** Oracle Database 23ai  
- **Backend:** Java / Spring, Node.js, or Python (project-dependent)  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, CI/CD, Cloud (as needed)  
- **AI:** Embeddings, RAG, tools, agents — applied pragmatically

---

## 📆 Daily Log

- **Day 0 — 2025-12-26:** Repository initialized. Manifesto published. Roadmap defined.
- **Day 1 — 2025-12-27:** Core concept of embeddings-based vector search validated through a working end-to-end demo.

Future days will extend this log — publicly.

## 🧭 Final Note

This repo begins **after Christmas 2025** for a reason.

It is not a “New Year resolution.”  
It is a **deadline-driven rebuild**.

If you are reading this as a recruiter or hiring manager:  
everything here is raw, chronological, and real.

No rewrites. No backfilling.
